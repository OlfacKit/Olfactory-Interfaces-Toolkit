# OlfacKit

A Toolkit for Integrating Atomization-Based Olfactory Interfaces into daily scenarios

To increase the ubiquity and merging of Olfactory Interfaces (OIs) into daily scenarios seamlessly and aesthetically, we propose OlfacKit, a fully integrated pipeline, which consists of (1) an interactive design tool that enables novice users to quickly model the physical forms of OIs and automatically generate fabrication-ready designs; (2) a construction workflow with a series of assembly kits and a video tutorial; (3) a WebUI for rapidly testing and prototyping smell control through Wi-Fi communication. We tested the atomization performance with different voltages and aroma liquids and further guided the implementation of the WebUI. Six applications have been explored, showing the flexibility and scalability of our toolkit.
